# Weather-Generator

A weather generator produces a “synthetic” time series of weather data for a location based on the statistical characteristics of observed weather at that location. You can think of a weather generator as being a simulator of future weather based on observed past weather. A time series is a collection of observations generated sequentially through time. The special feature of a time series is that successive observations are usually expected to be dependent, in the case of forecasting a day’s weather depends on the previous day’s weather.
